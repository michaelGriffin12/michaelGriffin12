# Profile Introduction
Welcome to my profile, my name is Michael Griffin.
This page will contain some of my code, you may critique as you wish.
Please keep in mind that the code I place here may not be of production value,
so please excersise caution if you decide to use it.
If you need my help, or you wish for me to extend a specific program,
please let me know.
If you wish to inquire about my knowledge,
then make a pull request about your requested topic.
More than likely, I will not be able to engage on any broad political topic,
due to that not being my area of focus.
However, anything technical and analytical is welcomed.

# Repository summary
None of the repositories currently listed on my account are anything major.
They are simple test projects, which currently comprise of little value.

Soon, I may be posting something akin to a 'white paper,'
which will dive into the technical aspects of one of my future projects in precise detail,
before finally completing the end result (and posting that onto here, as well).
